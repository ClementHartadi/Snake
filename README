# Snake
Snake game using Java
**THE USE OF CONSTRUCTORS, GETTERS, SETTERS, AND GLOBAL PUBLIC VARIABLES/OBJECTS WILL BE ESSENTIAL FOR HAVING THIS MANY CLASSES
**CONNECTING THE CLASSES TOGETHER WILL PROBABLY BE THE HARDEST THING THAT WE WILL BE DOING.

Classes and things to do
//View
//    GUI
//        Frame holds it all
//        Textbox for showing results
//        Start button
//        Panel that contains the snake game
//    StartButton 
//        ActionListener that handles the startbutton in GUI
//    KeyBoard 
//         handles keylistener for the arrow keys

//Control
//    Main 
//        This is where we will conect everything and where public static void main(String[] args) will be

//Model
//    PositionArray
//        Class for the position array and manipulating the array using getter and setters
//    Timer
//        Class that deals with timer
//    Snake
//        Main Snake class that connects all other Snake classes
//    SnakeMovement
//        How the snake reacts to move with the timer (teleporting, moving with a certain velocity, etc)
//    SnakeTurn
//        the physics behind how the snake turns, based on timer and current position
//    SnakeCollision
//        physics for the snakehead collision, will probably need positionarray
//    Food
//        handles food spawning based on positionarray

Things to do and figure out
//Snake turning and movement
//how to use the timer
//how to have a running code create Jobjects and new snake objects
